# SVM(Support Vector Machine) Algorithm
The aim of the project is to use only two properties, width and length, to classify apples as ripe or immature in the two-dimensional apple dataset. The SVM algorithm we created will use these two features to find the best hyperplane that separates ripe apples from unripe apples. The location of the hyperplane will be determined by the width and length of the apples, and apples with the width and length falling on one side of the hyperplane will be classified as ripe, while apples on the other side will be classified as unripe.
