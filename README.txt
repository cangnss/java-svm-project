It works with Weka and JFreeChart libraries in the project. 
First, after importing the project in Eclipse, Netbeans or Intellij, right click on the project and add the 
necessary libraries to Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> ClassPath -> Add External JARs. 
It will then run when the project is run.
